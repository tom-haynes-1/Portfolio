        <h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
        <p>Originally from Peterborough, I have now lived and worked in Manchester for 4 years. I currently work in e-commerce as a Customer Experience Executive.</p>
        <p>I came across coding by speaking with developers in my job and how some of their actions directly impact our customer base. I tried out some free online tutorials resources and really enjoyed it! I'm looking to transition into the Tech industry so decided to take the plunge and enrol on Manchester Codes Software Engineering bootcamp.</p>
